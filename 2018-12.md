## December 2018

### Day 062: December 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Read up, and restructured Twitter CL!

**Topics**: NPM publishing, setting up command-line tools

**Thoughts**: This project was actually a pretty interesting one to take on. After reading up on it a bit, I don't think it will be too challenging but I want to make sure to stay organized with it. My problem right now is figuring out sign-in and credential management in a CLI.

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Work on the Conway Game!

---

### Day 063: December 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started setup for the Conway project!

**Topics**: Sass with CRA, package.json scripts, node-sass,

**Thoughts**: It felt cool actually seeing the `fs` script I wrote work in writing a combined sass file. I know there's definitely better ways to do it, but mine works and I feel accomplished!

**Links**: [Conway Repo][conw]

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Get through some [exercism.io][ex] tracks, and prototype the Conway Project.

---

### Day 064: December 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Prototyped Conway's Game of Life

**Topics**: Data Visualization, React State with Intervals

**Thoughts**: I am actually really proud of how it ended up turning out, it looks really good! It's really zen to watch it do its thing.

**Links**: [Conway Repo][conw]

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Style the thing!

---

### Day 065: December 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Played around with Ant.Design for the Conway project.

**Topics**: Ant.Design, Webpage Layouts

**Thoughts**: Ant is actually really damn pretty, I like it a lot. Unfortunately, my component tree is getting pretty wonky, but I'm doing my best to keep it together.

**Links**: [Conway Repo][conw]

**Goals for Tomorrow**: More styling, maybe some Unity

---

### Day 066: December 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Setup Redux structure for Conway app

**Topics**: Redux Actions/Reducers/Store, Pure Functions

**Thoughts**: Redux is way harder than I thought it was from just doing the course. Also, I really shouldn't half do the Ant stuff, then decide to switch to Redux. TL;DR, I am drowning.

**Links**: [Conway Repo][conw]

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Start dispatching actions!

---

### Day 067: December 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: [Exercism][ex] track progression

**Topics**: TypeScript, and C#

**Thoughts**: I really, really, really hate C#. It makes sense with Unity, but oh my god does trying to figure out this `.sln`, `.cs`, `.csproj` stuff make me angry. HOW DO I RUN CODE LIKE AT ALL. HOW DO I `console.log` OR DEBUG OR ANYTHING! WHY IS VISUAL STUDIO SO INCREDIBLY CONFUSING. I hate it.

**Links**: [Exercism Repo][exr]

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Maybe some Unity, probably some Conway Redux stuff as well.

---

### Day 068: December 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Lots of progress in the Conway UI.

**Topics**: Implementing Redux

**Thoughts**: I think I finally understand Redux, but I also think it's WAAAY more powerful than I needed for this sort of app. THat being said, I am learning how to use it properly, so...there's that. All in all, a productive day.

**Links**: [Conway Repo][conw]

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Some Unity tutorials, maybe look at TCL. 

---

### Day 069: December 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Redesigned Conway UI

**Topics**: Ant.Design, ReactTransitionGroup

**Thoughts**: I definitely could have done more today, but I'm still happy with what I did get done. This thing is taking much longer than I thought I would need, but I tend to go overboard with these things.

**Links**: [Conway Repo][conw]

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Do some more of the Unity Tutorials, I think I should leave Conway for a bit.

---

### Day 070: December 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: [Space Shooter Tutorial][utc] Progress!

**Topics**: Scripting Waves and Game Object Destruction

**Thoughts**: I really enjoy working with Unity but I really think I've just barely scratched the surface of what it can do. Today is also one of the few days where I actually followed through with my _Goals for Tomorrow_ in my work today, so that's pretty cool.

**Links**: [Unity Tutorials Repo][utr]

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Really get that UI done, or near done for Conway! It's taking way too long! Also, record those GIFs!

---

### Day 071: December 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Deployed Conway today!

**Topics**: Styling with Ant.Design

**Thoughts**: I usually enjoy CSS but I think it takes too much time. I found myself getting annoyed at having to deal with Ant's restrictions and just ended up trying to finish off fast. I think it's a good sign that I can prioritize.

**Links**: [Conway Repo][conw], [Live Demo](http://conway.leander.xyz)

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Finish off the Unity Space Shooter Tutorial, and take a look at [Advanced React][arc].

---

### Day 072: December 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Deployed the Space Shooter Tutorial!

**Topics**: Unity Deployment, UI, Scores, Controllers

**Thoughts**: I finished off the Unity Space Shooter Tutorial, and I gotta say I'm pretty happy. I really think I get what's going on with Unity now, and I can totally see myself building some more stuff with it in the future.

**Links**: [Unity Tutorial Repo][utr], [Live Demo][http://space-shooter.leander.xyz]

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Probably just get a litte more done for TCLI, or start something new, we'll see

---

### Day 073: December 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Nothing!

**Topics**: Livin' Life

**Thoughts**: Office Christmas Party today, so I got back late, I'll make it up tomorrow. Gonna take Friday off as well.

**Links**: N/A

**Goals for Tomorrow**: 2h of Code

---

### Day 074: December 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Wrote the README for Conway, and messed around with some Open Source video recording and editing software.

**Topics**: Video Editing/Recording

**Thoughts**: This is just a really hectic week, I'm going to make up for it I swear.

**Links**: [Conway Repo][conw]

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Nothing, another Holiday Party!

---

### Day 075: December 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Exactly what I thought I'd do!

**Topics**: Nothing!

**Thoughts**: I'm going to start the GatsbyJS and NetlifyCMS blog project tomorrow. I think my site definitely needs a v2.0, it doesn't exactly hold up IMHO.

**Links**: N/A

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Start with Gatsby and NetlifyCMS

---

### Day 076: December 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Explored [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org) and [Netlify CMS](https://netlifycms.org/)

**Topics**: GatsbyJS, Netlify CMS 

**Thoughts**: I really think that if I can get this working my site will be like a million times as good. I mean honestly, the amount of stuff out of the box: progressive images, routing via folders, react integration, SEO, is just amazing. But honestly what even is GraphQL.

**Links**: [New Site Repo][nsr]

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Mess around with Gatsby and Netlify some more, then maybe do some TS challenges on [exercism][ex].

---

### Day 077: December 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked some more with the new site stack

**Topics**: OAuth via GitHub, Site Configuration

**Thoughts**: Set up my deploy system through Netlify, and I think this is the way of the future. On [Syntax](https://syntax.fm) they always talk about how everyone loves [Netlify](https://netlify.com), and I gotta say, I kinda get that now.

**Links**: [New Site Repo][nsr]

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Do some work with Unity, maybe extend the Space Shooter game.

---

### Day 078: December 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Two TypeScript challenges on [exercism][ex].

**Topics**: ES6 TypeScript, Data manipulation

**Thoughts**: After working with C# heavily at work, I kind of see the appeal in having a typed language. Specifying who exactly has access to your data, and how, is pretty nice.

**Links**: [Exercism Repo][exr]

**Goals for Tomorrow**: More Exercism, and some Gatsby Stuff

---

### Day 079: December 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Typescript and Gatsby

**Topics**: TS Algorithms, Gatsby/Netlify/Git Integration

**Thoughts**: Man oh man, Gatsby and Netlify work so well together. It's crazy how easy it is to write and read blog posts and stuff with this stack. I can't wait to explore some more.

**Links**: [New Site Repo][nsr]

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Set up first post, Start a GraphQL course.
