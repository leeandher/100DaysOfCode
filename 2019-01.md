### Still on that break!

### Day 091: January 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Wrapped up GraphQL Server on [HTGQL][htgql]!

**Topics**: Prisma Client CRUD, Debugging, GraphQL Yoga

**Thoughts**: I finally fixed the GraphQL server and managed to finish the backend course I've been working on. I think the whole REST vs GraphQL thing is making sense, but designing a server API from the ground up is still really hard. I don't entirely understand why the Prisma Client wasn't just wired up directly to the front-end, why did we abstract a layer?

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Start on the Frontend! (Apollo + React)

### Day 092: January 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started on the Frontend, repaired some server stuff, reworked env variables. (All for [HTGQL][htgql]).

**Topics**: ENV with YML, Prisma deletion process

**Thoughts**: The front-end feels like home, I think I can get through this tutorial pretty quickly, hopefully wrapping up before the end of th 100 Days.

**Goals for Tomorrow**: More frontend stuff!

### Day 094: January 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Made up for yesterday with a good chunk of Frontend React for [HTGQL][htgql].

**Topics**: Apollo Client Integration with GraphQL backend, Render Props in React

**Thoughts**: The site is really coming together, and conceptually I'm understanding what's going on, but the syntax involved with using the `ApolloClient` and everything like that is really frustrating! I know that if I didn't have the code right there, the simple hooking-up code would take me forever, just because I never know what to look for in the docs.

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Do a bunch more front-end for the Stacker News Repo (maybe finish it?)!
