**Today's Progress**: Wrapped up GraphQL Server on [HTGQL][htgql]!

**Topics**: Prisma Client CRUD, Debugging, GraphQL Yoga

**Thoughts**: I finally fixed the GraphQL server and managed to finish the backend course I've been working on. I think the whole REST vs GraphQL thing is making sense, but designing a server API from the ground up is still really hard. I don't entirely understand why the Prisma Client wasn't just wired up directly to the front-end, why did we abstract a layer?
