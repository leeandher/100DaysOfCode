# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 001: October 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed the 18th challenge in the [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com) online course.

**Topics**: Array.reduce() method

**Thoughts:** I want to work on styling these and making each project look good on its own, even if it's really time consuming. I also want to start working on something outside of a course, something else I can call my own preferably.

**Goals for Tomorrow:** I would like to complete the 19th JS30 challenge, as well as start the [ReactForBeginners](reactforbeginners.com) course.

### Day 002: October 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed the 19th [JS30](https://javascript30.com) challenge

**Topics**: HTML5 Canvas, Contexts, and the Webcam/Image Browser API

**Thoughts**: I didn't end up getting to the React stuff because of how long the JS30 challenge was today, but I did manage to submit my request for the Twitter API. School and Coop are battling for most of my time, so I have to strike a balance if I'm going to make it to Day 100.
