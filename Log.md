# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 001: October 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed the 18th challenge in the [JavaScript30][js30c] online course.

**Topics**: Array.reduce() method

**Thoughts:** I want to work on styling these and making each project look good on its own, even if it's really time consuming. I also want to start working on something outside of a course, something else I can call my own preferably.

**Links:** [JS30/18 - Reduction][js30r]

**Goals for Tomorrow:** I would like to complete the 19th JS30 challenge, as well as start the [ReactForBeginners][rfbc] course.

### Day 002: October 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed the 19th [JS30][js30c] challenge

**Topics**: HTML5 Canvas, Contexts, and the Webcam/Image Browser API

**Thoughts**: I didn't end up getting to the React stuff because of how long the JS30 challenge was today, but I did manage to submit my request for the Twitter API. School and Coop are battling for most of my time, so I have to strike a balance if I'm going to make it to Day 100.

**Goals for Tomorrow:** Complete 20th JS30 challenge and try to start the [RFB][rfbc] course.

### Day 003: October 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed the 20th [JS30][js30c] challenge, started the [RFB][rfbc] course, gained access to the Twitter Dev API!

**Topics**: Microphone Access, Speech Recognition API, React Components, React Rendering

**Thoughts**: I definitely feel good for completing my goals that I had for today, and I'm definitely starting to pick up some steam. I installed like 4 VSCode extensions today, so you know I'm invested.

**Goals for Tomorrow:** Complete 21st JS30 Challenge, keep working through RFB, mess around with the Twitter API if I get the chance.

---

### Day 004: October 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed the 21st and 22nd [JS30][js30c] challenge, completed a few more components in the [RFB][rfbc] course, and read around the docs for the Twitter API

**Topics**: Navigator Geolocation, Dynamic Elements, React Components, Intro to Props

**Thoughts**: I definitely feel good for completing my goals that I had for today, and I'm definitely starting to pick up some steam. I installed like 4 VSCode extensions today, so you know I'm invested.

**Links**: [JS30/21 and 22][js30r], [RFB][rfbr], [Twitter Docs](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs.html)

**Goals for Tomorrow:** JS30 22 (clean up some old CSS too), some RFB, and get set up with the Twitter API (start a repo).

---

### Day 005: October 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed the 23rd [JS30][js30c] challenge, began assembling larger components, and changing state in [RFB][rfbc] and watch the [Mastering Markdown](https://masteringmarkdown.com/) course (to get faster at writing these logs)

**Topics**: Modern Browsers' Speech Synthesis API, and in React, creating Refs, passing State, custom Props, and binding. Lastly some Markdown stuff.

**Thoughts**: Today was a really productive day, and I definitely feel like I have a better understanding of React.js. I really enjoy working on courses, but I do think I should be focusing on some other stuff as well, be a project or maybe some algorithm/data structure practice.

**Goals for Tomorrow:** I didn't get around to cleaning up that CSS, so maybe take care of that, do JS30 24, some more RFB and if time permits, start something with the Twitter API.

### Day 006: October 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed the 24th [JS30][js30c] challenge, and pretty much spent a few hours after that just fixing up the CSS in all the other JS30 challenges that I've been rushing through honestly.

**Topics**: Dynamic Navigation Bar (Sticky Nav), CSS Animations/Styling

**Thoughts**: I got a pretty late start today and I have a bunch of personal stuff happening at home so I didn't really have the chance to get anything too _meaty_ done but I'm still happy!

**Links**: [JS30/24][js30r], but the CSS changes are from 19-23

**Goals for Tomorrow:** JS30 25, and a whole lot of RFB! With any luck, my plan is to get started on the twitter thing by maybe Day 008

---

### Day 007: October 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed the 25th [JS30][js30c] challenge, and did a whole lot of [RFB][rfbc] afterwards.

**Topics**: Event propagation, bubbling, and capture. State persistence (through Local Storage and Firebase), as well as state/props syncing

**Thoughts**: I got what felt like quite a bit done so that's really exciting, but I did think it took me a little long for the amount of work it. Completely subjective, but I am happy with how I did today!

**Links**: [JS30/25][js30r], [RFB/Until Lesson 19][rfbr]

**Goals for Tomorrow:** JS30 26, more RFB and plan out the Twitter API thing!

---

### Day 008: October 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed the 26th [JS30][js30c] challenge and got started looking into Twitter API.

**Topics**: Navigation animations, and the Twitter API!

**Thoughts**: Today was Thanksgiving in Canada, so I didn't get a whole lot done, but I still managed to accomplish some JS30 and got a good intro to the twitter API. I don't know how I'm going to make a CLI for it in Node, but atleast I have the idea!

**Links**: [JS30/26][js30r], [Twitter from CLI Repository][tcli]

**Goals for Tomorrow:** JS30 26 and complete a good chunk of the [RFB][rfbc] course. If time permits, look more into how I can make the CLI thing.
