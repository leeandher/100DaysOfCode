# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 001: October 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed the 18th challenge in the [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com) online course.

**Topics**: Array.reduce() method

**Thoughts:** I want to work on styling these and making each project look good on its own, even if it's really time consuming. I also want to start working on something outside of a course, something else I can call my own preferably.

**Goals for Tomorrow:** I would like to complete the 19th JS30 challenge, as well as start the [ReactForBeginners](reactforbeginners.com) course.

### Day 002: October 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed the 19th [JS30](https://javascript30.com) challenge

**Topics**: HTML5 Canvas, Contexts, and the Webcam/Image Browser API

**Thoughts**: I didn't end up getting to the React stuff because of how long the JS30 challenge was today, but I did manage to submit my request for the Twitter API. School and Coop are battling for most of my time, so I have to strike a balance if I'm going to make it to Day 100.

**Goals for Tomorrow:** Complete 20th JS30 challenge and try to start the [RFB](reactforbeginners.com) course.

### Day 003: October 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed the 20th [JS30](https://javascript30.com) challenge, started the [RFB](reactforbeginners.com) course, gained access to the Twitter Dev API!

**Topics**: Microphone Access, Speech Recognition API, React Components, React Rendering

**Thoughts**: I definitely feel good for completing my goals that I had for today, and I'm definitely starting to pick up some steam. I installed like 4 VSCode extensions today, so you know I'm invested.

**Goals for Tomorrow:** Complete 21st JS30 Challenge, keep working through RFB, mess around with the Twitter API if I get the chance.

### Day 004: October 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed the 21st and 22nd [JS30](https://javascript30.com) challenge, completed a few more components in the [RFB](reactforbeginners.com) course, and read around the docs for the Twitter API

**Topics**: Navigator Geolocation, Dynamic Elements, React Components, Intro to Props

**Thoughts**: I definitely feel good for completing my goals that I had for today, and I'm definitely starting to pick up some steam. I installed like 4 VSCode extensions today, so you know I'm invested.

**Links**: [JS30/21 and 22](https://github.com/leeandher/JavaScript30/), [RFB](https://github.com/leeandher/React-For-Beginners/), [Twitter Docs](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs.html)

**Goals for Tomorrow:** JS30 22 (clean up some old CSS too), some RFB, and get set up with the Twitter API (start a repo).

### Day 005: October 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed the 23rd [JS30](https://javascript30.com) challenge, began assembling larger components, and changing state in [RFB](reactforbeginners.com) and watch the [Mastering Markdown](https://masteringmarkdown.com/) course (to get faster at writing these logs)

**Topics**: Modern Browsers' Speech Synthesis API, and in React, creating Refs, passing State, custom Props, and binding. Lastly some Markdown stuff.

**Thoughts**: Today was a really productive day, and I definitely feel like I have a better understanding of React.js. I really enjoy working on courses, but I do think I should be focusing on some other stuff as well, be a project or maybe some algorithm/data structure practice.

**Links**: [JS30/23](https://github.com/leeandher/JavaScript30/), [RFB](https://github.com/leeandher/React-For-Beginners/), [Mastering Markdown](https://masteringmarkdown.com/)

**Goals for Tomorrow:** I didn't get around to cleaning up that CSS, so maybe take care of that, do JS30 24, some more RFB and if time permits, staart something with the Twitter API.
