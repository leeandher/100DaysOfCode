# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: October 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed the 18th Challenge in the [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com) online course.

**Thoughts:** I want to work on styling these and making each project look good on its own, even if it's really time consuming. I also want to start working on something outside of a course, something else I can call my own preferably.
