## December 2018

### Day 062: December 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Read up, and restructured Twitter CL!

**Topics**: NPM publishing, setting up command-line tools

**Thoughts**: This project was actually a pretty interesting one to take on. After reading up on it a bit, I don't think it will be too challenging but I want to make sure to stay organized with it. My problem right now is figuring out sign-in and credential management in a CLI. 

**Links**: [TCL Repo][tcli]

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Work on the Conway Game!

---

### Day 063: December 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started setup for the Conway project!

**Topics**: Sass with CRA, package.json scripts, node-sass,

**Thoughts**: It felt cool actually seeing the `fs` script I wrote work in writing a combined sass file. I know there's definitely better ways to do it, but mine works and I feel accomplished!

**Links**: [Conway Repo][conw]

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Get through some [exercism.io][ex] tracks, and prototype the Conway Project.

---

### Day 003: December 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed the 20th [JS30][js30c] challenge, started the [RFB][rfbc] course, gained access to the Twitter Dev API!

**Topics**: Microphone Access, Speech Recognition API, React Components, React Rendering

**Thoughts**: I definitely feel good for completing my goals that I had for today, and I'm definitely starting to pick up some steam. I installed like 4 VSCode extensions today, so you know I'm invested.

**Links**: [JS30/20 - Step Up to the Mic][js30r]

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Complete 21st JS30 Challenge, keep working through RFB, mess around with the Twitter API if I get the chance.

---

### Day 004: December 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed the 21st and 22nd [JS30][js30c] challenge, completed a few more components in the [RFB][rfbc] course, and read around the docs for the Twitter API

**Topics**: Navigator Geolocation, Dynamic Elements, React Components, Intro to Props

**Thoughts**: I didn't find myself as interested in JS30 today as much as doing React. I think front-end frameworks just offer some variety or something that scratches a weird itch.

**Links**: [JS30/21 and 22][js30r], [RFB][rfbr], [Twitter Docs](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs.html)

**Goals for Tomorrow**: JS30 22 (clean up some old CSS too), some RFB, and get set up with the Twitter API (start a repo).

---

### Day 005: December 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed the 23rd [JS30][js30c] challenge, began assembling larger components, and changing state in [RFB][rfbc] and watch the [Mastering Markdown](https://masteringmarkdown.com/) course (to get faster at writing these logs)

**Topics**: Modern Browsers' Speech Synthesis API, and in React, creating Refs, passing State, custom Props, and binding. Lastly some Markdown stuff.

**Thoughts**: Today was a really productive day, and I definitely feel like I have a better understanding of React.js. I really enjoy working on courses, but I do think I should be focusing on some other stuff as well, be a project or maybe some algorithm/data structure practice.

**Links**: [JS30/23][js30r], [RFB][rfbr], [Mastering Markdown](https://masteringmarkdown.com/)

**Goals for Tomorrow**: I didn't get around to cleaning up that CSS, so maybe take care of that, do JS30 24, some more RFB and if time permits, start something with the Twitter API.

---

### Day 006: December 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed the 24th [JS30][js30c] challenge, and pretty much spent a few hours after that just fixing up the CSS in all the other JS30 challenges that I've been rushing through honestly.

**Topics**: Dynamic Navigation Bar (Sticky Nav), CSS Animations/Styling

**Thoughts**: I got a pretty late start today and I have a bunch of personal stuff happening at home so I didn't really have the chance to get anything too _meaty_ done but I'm still happy!

**Links**: [JS30/24][js30r], but the CSS changes are from 19-23

**Goals for Tomorrow**: JS30 25, and a whole lot of RFB! With any luck, my plan is to get started on the twitter thing by maybe Day 008

---

### Day 007: December 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed the 25th [JS30][js30c] challenge, and did a whole lot of [RFB][rfbc] afterwards.

**Topics**: Event propagation, bubbling, and capture. State persistence (through Local Storage and Firebase), as well as state/props syncing

**Thoughts**: I got what felt like quite a bit done so that's really exciting, but I did think it took me a little long for the amount of work it. Completely subjective, but I am happy with how I did today!

**Links**: [JS30/25][js30r], [RFB/Until Lesson 19][rfbr]

**Goals for Tomorrow**: JS30 26, more RFB and plan out the Twitter API thing!

---

### Day 008: December 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed the 26th [JS30][js30c] challenge and got started looking into Twitter API.

**Topics**: Navigation animations, and the Twitter API!

**Thoughts**: Today was Thanksgiving in Canada, so I didn't get a whole lot done, but I still managed to accomplish some JS30 and got a good intro to the twitter API. I don't know how I'm going to make a CLI for it in Node, but at least I have the idea!

**Links**: [JS30/26][js30r], [Twitter from CLI Repository][tcli]

**Goals for Tomorrow**: JS30 26 and complete a good chunk of the [RFB][rfbc] course. If time permits, look more into how I can make the CLI thing.

---

### Day 009: December 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed the 27th [JS30][js30c] challenge and started messing around with some Node stuff, trying to get my 'Hello World!' via CLI.

**Topics**: Click and Drag Scrolling, NPM and Node.js CLI shenanigans

**Thoughts**: Busy day today, so I didn't really get too much done, but I still managed to complete and style JS30 27. It's coming to a close, which is pretty exciting but also somewhat scary. As for the Twitter for CLI thing, it really is proving to be harder than I thought to get started, let alone integrate the Twitter API.

**Links**: [JS30/27][js30r], [Twitter from CLI][tcli]

**Goals for Tomorrow**: JS30 28, maybe some more Node CLI stuff if I get the time. Tomorrow is my Mom's Birthday!

---

### Day 010: December 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed the 28th [JS30][js30c] challenge and made my first few Twitter API calls for the [Twitter-From-CLI][tcli] project!

**Topics**: HTMLMediaElement Controls via JS, NPM CLI installs/links, Twitter API calls

**Thoughts**: I'm happy with my finishing another JS30 challenge, but I'm more excited that it's coming to a close. I want to get back on the [RFB][rfbc] train, AND I actually just bought [Advanced React][argc] as well. Big plans ahead! PS:Happy Birthday Mom!

**Links**: [JS30/28][js30r], [Twitter from CLI][tcli]

**Goals for Tomorrow**: JS30 29, and get some more RFB done. Maybe consider doing that [Ginit demo project](https://www.sitepoint.com/javascript-command-line-interface-cli-node-js/) I found online.

---

### Day 011: December 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed the 29th [JS30][js30c] challenge, and some more React Basics in [RFB][rfbc]

**Topics**: Time and Date Objects in JS, State changes through Children in React, React CSS Transition Grouping

**Thoughts**: Wow, I'm going to finish JS30! This is crazy! My plan is to start the [Learn Node][lnc] right after so we'll see how that goes. It was a lot of fun, but I'm honestly seeing myself enjoying doing more React stuff right now, so let's keep the momentum going!

**Links**: [JS30/29][js30r], [RFB/Until Lesson 22][rfbc]

**Goals for Tomorrow**: JS30 30! Finish that course up!

---

### Day 012: December 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed some more work in [RFB][rfbc], leaving JS30:30 for a non-busy day

**Topics**: Component Validation in React, and [TIS-100][tis]

**Thoughts**: I feel pretty excited to sit down and code whenever I get the chance and I think that means that this repetition thing is working. I find time passing WAY faster than I think though, so I might have to work on my work speed/productivity. On a side note, I got really into a new game I just downloaded which has kind of a program-y vibe to it. It's called [TIS-100][tis], and if you're reading this, you'll probably like it.

**Links**: [RFB/Until Lesson 23][rfbc], [TIS-100][tis]

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Tomorrow is another crammed day, so done just try to get some more done in React for Beginners.

---

### Day 013: December 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed Authentication in [RFB][rfbc]!

**Topics**: User Authentication (through GitHub, Twitter, and Facebook) via Firebase, along with Security Rules

**Thoughts**: I took my time going through the Authentication process to make sure I did it right, but upon finishing, I realized that Firebase is pretty incredible, especially considering that it's free. I do think I should start branching out from coursework, but I really enjoy following along with an instructor. We shall see, going forward.

**Links**: [RFB/Until Lesson 24][rfbr]

**Goals for Tomorrow**: I think, if everything goes according to plan, I might be able to finish both [JS30][js30c], and [RFB][rfbc] tomorrow! If I have spare time after that, I want to get some work done with the [pdfmake npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pdfmake) (for my actual co-op job).

---

### Day 014: December 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed [JavaScript30][js30c] AND [React For Beginners][rfbc]!

**Topics**: Deploying/Hosting/Ejecting a create-react-app application, and In-browser Games

**Thoughts**: I finally finished those courses! JS30 was really a long time coming, but I'm glad I took my time to make each challenge a cool in its own right. RFB was also a great experience, especially since I could see the whole app coming together while I learned how to write proper React. Next step, combine the two, and make a JS30 showcase page in React!

**Links**: [JavaScript30 Repo][js30r] and [React-for-Beginners Repo][rfbr]

**Goals for Tomorrow**: I want to get started with the [Learn Node][lnc] tomorrow, and maybe, if I have time, try to get some more headway with the [Twitter CLI][tcli]!

---

### Day 015: December 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Took way too long, but setup for [Learn Node][lnc], and wrote the README.md for [Catch of the Day][rfbr].

**Topics**: MongoDB Installation/GUI, Server Initialization

**Thoughts**: The whole startup process was really tedious and difficult. There were errors popping up all over and I'm stil not 100% that I fixed everything properly. The problem with command line is I never know if I'm messing up or doing something major/permanent :/

**Links**: [Learn Node Repo][lnr]

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Finish the setup, and start some [Learn Node][lnc]

---

### Day 016: December 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed Module 1 and 2 of [Learn Node][lnc]

**Topics**: Concepts! (Routing, Templating, MVC, Middleware)

**Thoughts**: I'm still getting started with Express.js but I can already see myself getting into it, especially for my website. Template languages are a useful tool I wish I got into before. I am starting to fall for this backend stuff 😍😍

**Links**: [Learn Node Repo][lnr]

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Go through Module 2 again, and write some good notes, then try to get through Module 3.

---

### Day 017: December 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed Module 3 in [LN][lnc], Rewatched/Wrote notes on Module 1/2

**Topics**: Concepts Again! and Creating Models with Mixins

**Thoughts**: I don't like having to write notes on things but when I'm learning so much so fast, I think it's important for reference. On a side note, `//TODO: Externalize notes into my programming-notes repository`.

**Links**: [Learn Node Repo][lnr]

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Complete 1/2 of Module 4, finish up-to-date notes

---

### Day 018: December 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed 1/2 of Mod 4 in [LN][lnc], caught up with notes until Mod 3!

**Topics**: MVC, Async Await, Flash Messages

**Thoughts**: This course is really in depth. It's definitely more challenging than the last one, so I think it was a good choice, but that being said, I'm really enjoying it. Backend JS is so formal, and structured, especially with the DB calls. I think from now on, I'm going to write notes on the Module once I complete it, just to solidify everything.

**Links**: [Learn Node Repo][lnr]

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Complete the rest of Module 4, Write notes on it.

---

### Day 019: December 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Wrote some more notes and practiced with the stuff in first half [Module 4][lnc].

**Topics**: Creating Models, Async/Await vs. Promises vs. Callback Hell

**Thoughts**: Today was more conceptual than anything but I'm glad I got something done, even though I was pretty busy. Tomorrow will probably be even worse but that's life! I rearranged and formalized the notes too. I think I should be reading them over before the next module just so I can get them down pat before moving on.

**Links**: [Learn Node Repo][lnr] (notes are in their own directory)

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Complete Module 4 in [Learn Node][lnc]

---

### Day 020: December 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed [Module 4][lnc] and wrote some more helpful notes.

**Topics**: Creating a control flow, and querying the DB

**Thoughts**: I really do think I'm following along, but the best way to test myself might just be to try and build something on my own. I think losing that ability to pause, seek, and replay (along with clear cut instructions) might make this stuff really challenging.

**Links**: [Learn Node Repo][lnr] (notes are in their own directory)

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Tomorrow's busy, so maybe just get started with Module 5.

---

### Day 021: December 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed [Module 5 and 6][lnc]

**Topics**: Geolocation w/ Google Maps API, File Handling for Images

**Thoughts**: In the Learn Node course today, there was a section where Wes had said that 'if you feel comfortable, you can pause the video here and try it yourself', and lo and behold I was able to get it working! These notes really help with understanding this MVC stuff, but then again, I still missed an edge case after I was finished.

**Links**: [Learn Node Repo][lnr]

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Write notes on Module 5 and 6, start Module 7 if time permits

---

### Day 022: December 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Wrote Notes on Module 5, Picked a editor font, and solid colour theme.

**Topics**: Geolocation and DB Management, Workflow Personalization/Improvement

**Thoughts**: I think that personalizing your desktop/editor/work environment is a really important part when it comes to being productive. Sure I wasn't coding for 2h today, but I'll be better focused tomorrow with a setup I really like!

**Links**: [Learn Node Repo][lnr], [Font](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode), [Colour Scheme](draculatheme.com)

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Start Module 7 and write notes on Module 6

---

### Day 023: December 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed Module 7 AND caught up completely with my note-taking!

**Topics**: MongoDB Aggregations, Pipeline Stages and Parallel JS Promises

**Thoughts**: Today was a good, productive day so that's awesome! 🙌🙌 I definitely think that as tedious as it may be, writing notes is really helping me understand the flow of the data through the app, so I'm gonna keep it up.

**Links**: [Learn Node Repo][lnr]

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Start Module 8, and if time permits, write some notes

---

### Day 024: December 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started Module 8, Created User Login Forms, and Validated Register Info

**Topics**: Passport.js Validation,

**Thoughts**: Today was okay, but it took me pretty long to get through something that maybe should've taken 45m. I want to be able to get through this stuff faster, but I think this is the only way I can really learn it. Next, I want to comment what I have so far, write some notes, and install ESLint, because that's way harder than it should be.

**Links**: [Learn Node Repo][lnr]

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Finish some more Module 8, Write some notes

---

### Day 025: December 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed User Authentication and Registration! ([1/2 Mod 8][lnc])

**Topics**: Password Hashing Middleware through Passport.js, Database Setup

**Thoughts**: Today went well, and it marks my 1/4 the way to D100! That's pretty exciting. I also had a few ideas for something I could do later on. I want to try to make some SPA apps in some of the front end frameworks. I don't really know how I would go about doing this but I think It's a cool idea. Like a DevGameHub kinda thing. Anyway, just a thought!

**Links**: [Learn Node Repo][lnr]

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Start notes, and hopefully finish module 8!

---

### Day 026: December 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: A secret project!

**Topics**: Reading through Docs, Gulp.js, Plugins, Browser-Sync

**Thoughts**: Today I figured out a cool secret project I want to work on for a bit and I'm pretty excited! I think it'll go pretty well once I get it up and running, but I'm really no designer. As a cool sidenote, I did manage to set up and install a bunch of plugins for Gulp to automate my workflow!

**Links**: Not yet!

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Well it's my birthday so... Maybe some more of this stuff, and finish Mod 8, (but who knows).

---

### Day 027: December 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed my secret project, A belated birthday card for my girlfriend!

**Topics**: CSS Keyframes Animations, and Styling

**Thoughts**: I was just trying to get everything working and looking snazzy before I gave it to her today. She really liked it, so I take that as a good sign. That being said, It wasn't all that much technical JS work, but was still a cool learning experience (with Gulp.js and its plugins). Anyway, gotta enjoy the rest of my birthday so 👋👋.

**Links**: [HBD Card!](https://github.com/leeandher/Happy-Birthday-Jordine)

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Complete Module 8, (or atleast most of it) in [Learn Node][lnc]

---

### Day 028: December 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed module 8 of [Learn Node][lnc]

**Topics**: Virtual Fields in MDB, User Account Editing, Password Reset Flow

**Thoughts**: I think I'm getting the hand of the request -> response -> middleware design of the app, and I was actually able to do a lot of the process work in today's video set without just copying the solutions, or typing along with him. I think the notes should help me finalize that.

**Links**: [Learn Node Repo][lnr]

**Goals for Tomorrow**: As many notes on Module 8 as I can!

---

### Day 029: December 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Wrote a bunch of notes on [Learn Node][lnc]

**Topics**: Notes on Creating User Account Schemas

**Thoughts**: These notes get really hairy when you start talking about specific libraries, but I think they help me understand the control flow. I spent a long time writing very little, hopefully tomorrow goes better. Cool side note though, I bought the [domain](http://lgr.fyi) to start a new project, a URL shortener. I might be spreading myself thing but I got like 71 more days so now worries just yet. Happy Birthday Dad!

**Links**: [Learn Node Repo][lnr]

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Catch up with my notes, start looking at the URL shortening repository.

---

### Day 030: December 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Caught up with notes, started URL Shortener

**Topics**: Documenting User Account Settings, Password Reset Flow

**Thoughts**: Starting new projects is really exciting. I want to do a lot more with this, but I think I have to eventually move away from tutorials. that being said, I might just jump from a video series to a blog, but instructions are still just that, so TBH IDK.

**Links**: [Learn Node Repo][lnr], no link to the Shortener just yet

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Start the next Module in [Learn Node][lnc], and if time permits, do some more for the URL Shortener!

---

### Day 031: December 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed [Module 9][lnc], and worked on the URL Shortener

**Topics**: Sending email with Nodemailer, and User Population

**Thoughts**: I really don't think theres enough time in a day for me to work on this stuff, but goddamn am I really enjoying it. This URL Shortner is gonna be the bomb diggity. Happy Halloween!

**Links**: [Learn Node Repo][lnr]

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Write some notes on Module 9, and work on the URL Shortener
