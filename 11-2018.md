## November 2018

### Day 032: November 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed Notes on Module 9 of [Learn Node][lnc]

**Topics**: Sending Emails with Nodemailer, Creating Schema Relationships

**Thoughts**: I think I want to do a lot more of the side project stuff tomorrow. I hope I can get this MERN stack stuff set up and really try a real project on my own with these frameworks. That being said, I also really want to expand my horizons from just web development, I should really focus on some algorithm/data structure stuff too.

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Get some work done with the URL shortener, start Module 10

---

### Day 033: November 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Set up React frontend for the URL shortner, as well as Axios for fetch requests. Worked a lot on Validation for the database as well! In [Learn Node][lnc] I also completed the first half of Module 10.

**Topics**: Axios, Endpoints, Indexing and React/Express

**Thoughts**: I really do feel like a made good progress today. Setting up React with Express was pretty confusing to understand, but I think I understand now. I have to split up my app and instead of serving `views` from the backend, I just have to let `react-router` take care of it, and use the backend as an API.

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Hook up React to the validation for express requests, and Finish Module 10!

### Day 034: November 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Troubleshooting React and Express

**Topics**: Communicating between React and Express

**Thoughts**: I spent a lot of time trying to make the React frontend (for the URL shortener) coordinate with the existing Express functionality, but I think it may need a big refactor before it starts working as it should. I also have to look into `nginx` because I think that may end up being really important.

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Finish and Note on Module 10, Research for the URL Shortener

---

### Day 035: November 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed Module 10 in [Learn Node][lnc]

**Topics**: Vanilla Frontend JS, Preventing XSS Attacks

**Thoughts**: Learning about the Cross Site-scripting (XSS) attacks was definitely really interesting. To think that this has to be done wherever a user can submit data is crazy, I should really look into applying some sanitization to my own work.

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Write some notes on Module 10, Try to structure ideas for URL Shortener

---

### Day 036: November 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Wrote notes on Module 10 in [Learn Node][lnc] and got some more work done on the URL Shortener.

**Topics**: Indexing MongoDB, and Create React App

**Thoughts**: I think the hardest part about the URL shortener is going to be the redirecting. The `nginx` stuff is still very confusing to me, so I gotta figure that out first. I have the link creation part done (I think).

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Start Module 11, work on URL Shortener if time permits.

---

### Day 037: November 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed Module 11, and got a headstart with Styled Components in the URL Shortener!

**Topics**: `styled-components` and Google Maps via Express API

**Thoughts**: I think starting the URL Shortener was definitely a good call. That being said, I get absorbed into whatever I'm doing and the hours seem to flyby, so I don't have much spare time anymore. Still really really enjoying it, so everything is good! üëçüëç

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Write notes on Module 11, Try to formalize the backend on the URL Shortener, maybe add error handling

---

### Day 038: November 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Noted up Module 11 in [Learn Node][lnc] and started styling in the URL Shortener

**Topics**: Geospatial data in MongoDB, and styled component structuring

**Thoughts**: I am focusing a lot on the front-end of the URL shortener and I think that's a mistake on my part. I should probably make it functional before I make it pretty but I don't ever think I have enough time to work on these things.

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Start Module 12, and Look into `nginx` for the URL Shortener
