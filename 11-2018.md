## November 2018

### Day 032: November 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed Notes on Module 9 of [Learn Node][lnc]

**Topics**: Sending Emails with Nodemailer, Creating Schema Relationships

**Thoughts**: I think I want to do a lot more of the side project stuff tomorrow. I hope I can get this MERN stack stuff set up and really try a real project on my own with these frameworks. That being said, I also really want to expand my horizons from just web development, I should really focus on some algorithm/data structure stuff too.

**Links**: [Learn Node Repo][lnr]

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Get some work done with the URL shortener, start Module 10

---

### Day 033: November 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Set up React frontend for the URL shortner, as well as Axios for fetch requests. Worked a lot on Validation for the database as well! In [Learn Node][lnc] I also completed the first half of Module 10.

**Topics**: Axios, Endpoints, Indexing and React/Express

**Thoughts**: I really do feel like a made good progress today. Setting up React with Express was pretty confusing to understand, but I think I understand now. I have to split up my app and instead of serving `views` from the backend, I just have to let `react-router` take care of it, and use the backend as an API.

**Links**: [Learn Node Repo][lnr]

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Hook up React to the validation for express requests, and Finish Module 10!

---

### Day 034: November 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Troubleshooting React and Express

**Topics**: Communicating between React and Express

**Thoughts**: I spent a lot of time trying to make the React frontend (for the URL shortener) coordinate with the existing Express functionality, but I think it may need a big refactor before it starts working as it should. I also have to look into `nginx` because I think that may end up being really important.

**Links**: N/A

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Finish and Note on Module 10, Research for the URL Shortener

---

### Day 035: November 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed Module 10 in [Learn Node][lnc]

**Topics**: Vanilla Frontend JS, Preventing XSS Attacks

**Thoughts**: Learning about the Cross Site-scripting (XSS) attacks was definitely really interesting. To think that this has to be done wherever a user can submit data is crazy, I should really look into applying some sanitization to my own work.

**Links**: [Learn Node Repo][lnr]

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Write some notes on Module 10, Try to structure ideas for URL Shortener

---

### Day 036: November 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Wrote notes on Module 10 in [Learn Node][lnc] and got some more work done on the URL Shortener.

**Topics**: Indexing MongoDB, and Create React App

**Thoughts**: I think the hardest part about the URL shortener is going to be the redirecting. The `nginx` stuff is still very confusing to me, so I gotta figure that out first. I have the link creation part done (I think).

**Links**: [Learn Node Repo][lnr]

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Start Module 11, work on URL Shortener if time permits.

---

### Day 037: November 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed Module 11, and got a headstart with Styled Components in the URL Shortener!

**Topics**: `styled-components` and Google Maps via Express API

**Thoughts**: I think starting the URL Shortener was definitely a good call. That being said, I get absorbed into whatever I'm doing and the hours seem to flyby, so I don't have much spare time anymore. Still really really enjoying it, so everything is good! üëçüëç

**Links**: [Learn Node Repo][lnr]

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Write notes on Module 11, Try to formalize the backend on the URL Shortener, maybe add error handling

---

### Day 038: November 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Noted up Module 11 in [Learn Node][lnc] and started styling in the URL Shortener

**Topics**: Geospatial data in MongoDB, and styled component structuring

**Thoughts**: I am focusing a lot on the front-end of the URL shortener and I think that's a mistake on my part. I should probably make it functional before I make it pretty but I don't ever think I have enough time to work on these things.

**Links**: [Learn Node Repo][lnr]

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Start Module 12, and Look into `nginx` for the URL Shortener

---

### Day 039: November 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Did a LOT of reading today, as well as Moduel 12 of [Learn Node][lnc]

**Topics**: Client Side APIs, Reading (Gatsby, React Hooks (16.7a), Netlify, GraphQL)

**Thoughts**: I want to finish up Learn Node and start diving into some new stuff. Ahh there's so many cool things out there I want literally all of them.

**Links**: [Learn Node Repo][lnr]

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Notes on Module 12, Work on the URL Shortener some more

---

### Day 040: November 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed the [Learn Node][lnc] course!

**Topics**: Advanced Aggregation, Pagination, Deployment

**Thoughts**: I'm pretty happy with myself for finally getting to deploy this site! It was a long time going but the course itself was really informative, and it influenced a lot of the design decisions that I'm going to go with for the URL Shortener.

**Links**: [Learn Node Repo][lnr], [Live Demo!](now-thats-delicious-leeandher.herokuapp.com)

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Take it easy, get some work done on the URL Shortener.

---

### Day 041: November 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Research/Debugging on the URL Shortener

**Topics**: Debugging, Schema Hooks

**Thoughts**: I want to implement a counter on the URL generation so that I can create metrics on each link but it's proving more complicated than I'm thinking. The redirecting alone is already pretty confusing so maybe I should rethink scope for this project.

**Links**: N/A

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Try to figure out the redirecting, take a harder look at `nginx`.

---

### Day 042: November 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Spent a while longer trying to get the Redirecting Working

**Topics**: Client Side Routing, and Server Side Routing

**Thoughts**: I keep getting lost and confused with this project. I don't really know what to look up or what to ask to figure out how to solve the bugs I encounter and It's pretty frustrating. I look at other people code and I think it makes sense but I don't get what's going on behind the scenes and how I remedy that. Arrgh, I'm just frustrated today, that's all.

**Links**: N/A

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Organize my thoughts, and try to figure out how to do the routing properly.

---

### Day 043: November 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Setup first response and rendering from a private S3 Bucket!

**Topics**: AWS SDK, Policies, IAM, S3

**Thoughts**: Figuring out how to implement this is going to be a whole other problem, but for now, I'm just happy I set it up and it worked!

**Links**: [Learn Node Repo][lnr]

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Figure out the S3 bucket thing, attempt to server side render the URL Shortener.

---

### Day 044: November 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Redirecting, and Setup a Styling Library

**Topics**: Semantic UI, React Frontend

**Thoughts**: I think I have the logic behind the app done for the most part, but I should look into deployment to see if it works in the field.

**Links**: N/A

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Start [exercism](exercism.io)'s TypeScript track or the Learn Redux, style some more.

---

### Day 045: November 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Redid the UI, and Added More Validation

**Topics**: Client/Server Side Validation, Local Storage, UI/UX

**Thoughts**: I really feel like I got a lot done today! I want to deploy v1.0 soon just to test the waters, and I really should think about starting another course or something. AHHHHH!

**Links**: N/A

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Knock-out some TODOs, and get started with TypeScript.

---

### Day 046: November 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Deployed AWS Elastic Beanstalk Sample App to my URL, Started TypeScript [Exercism][ex] track.

**Topics**: AWS ELB, EC2, Route 53

**Thoughts**: This felt a lot harder than it should have been but I think the main reason was just how long it takes for Name Servers to change over on domain names, and how wonky DNS Records can get.

**Links**: [Exercism Repo][exr]

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Try to deploy my app, do some Todos, and do more TS challenges

---

### Day 047: November 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Integrating Express and React on the Same Port, SysAdmin Hell (Deploying to AWS), [Exercism][ex] TypeScript Track, Started [Learn Redux][lrc]

**Topics**: AWS ELB CLI, Express Routing, TypeScript, Redux

**Thoughts**: I did get a lot done but man oh man is AWS just so complicated. I feel like I spend most of my time trying to figure out credentials and polcies and a whole bunch of other stuff when I should be working on the projects themselves!

**Links**: [Learn Redux Repo][lrr], [Exercism Repo][exr]

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Get some more TS challenges done, and more of the Redux course.

---

### Day 048: November 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Made progress with URL Shortener, it's pretty much done, also got some more TS practice.

**Topics**: TypeScript (Return Types, Fields), and Express Error Handling

**Thoughts**: I think I'm making pretty decent headway with the URL Shortener, but man oh man do I not want to deploy. AWS is beyond intimidating. 

**Links**: [Exercism Repo][exr]

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Do the practice TS Challenges and more [Learn Redux][lrc]

---

### Day 049: November 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Did a few more TS challenges, setup the click counter on the URL Shortener, and got through more [Learn Redux][lrr]!

**Topics**: TypeScript, Redux (Providers, Actions, Reducers), Mongoose Post Hooks

**Thoughts**: I don't know whether or not it's really worth while learning Redux, especially with the new React Hooks API on the rise, but I still think it may be a useful skill for maintaining some actual work codebases. Enjoying the course so far, but It's going a little over my head, that means I gotta start taking some notes.

**Links**: [Learn Redux Repo][lrr], [Exercism Repo][exr]

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Finalize the URL Shortener, do more TS if the mentor comes through (otherwise Redux)

---

### Day 050: November 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Refactored front-end for URL Shortener, and configured Click Counter properly!

**Topics**: findOneAndUpdate, Stateless Functional Components

**Thoughts**: I'm almost there! The last step is to deploy and test, but man I don't wanna get near AWS... _shudder_. P.S. I want faster turn around times on [exercism.io][ex], the mentor marking takes way too long.

**Links**: N/A

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Do some TS if possible, attempt deployment!
