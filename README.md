# 100 Days Of Code

Welcome to my 100 Days of Code Repository! You won't actually find any code here, just a bunch of markdown files. These markdown files actually make up my daily logs, working side-by-side with my tweets to catalog my progress everyday. I took inspiration heavily from this [repository](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code), but made a few personal modifications.

If you're new to **#100DaysOfCode**, this is a _movement_ or something in which crazy people (like me), decide some random day that for the next **100 days** they are going to **code** for atleast **one hour every day**. If you miss a day, it's fine, as long as you make up for it by coding for **two hours the next day**.

That being said, this isn't about some title, or the streak or even the hashtag trending. This is sort of a journey that's supposed to enforce your commitment, and dedication towards getting about 1% of the way to becoming a master (~10000 hours) in the craft, in this case, coding.

It may seem trivial to begin with, but an hour a day can add up! It does wonders for productivity, learning, and just attitude towards the subject.

Anyway, long story short, I use this repo to record all my ramblings and thoughts. Doubtful I'll ever read them all, but one day it will be a cute stroll down memory lane ðŸ”¥ðŸ˜Ž!
