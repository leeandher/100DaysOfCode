# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Welcome to my 100 Days of Code Repository! You won't actually find any code here, just a bunch of markdown files. These markdown files actually make up my daily logs, working side-by-side with my tweets to catalog my progress everyday. I took inspiration heavily from this [repository](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code), but made a few personal modifications.
